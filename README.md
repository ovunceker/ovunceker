## Hello everyone 👋

🤔 The main reason why I opened up this GitHub page is to share the projects I'll be working on and to have a place for writing down the things I want to learn. 

👨‍💻 I've recently come across with data science and it instantly grasped my attention as a math person. I already knew some amount of Python and then I took an online course on SQL. That's why on most of my projects, I'll be using those two. My main goal for working on these projects is to combine these Python and SQL skills with the down to earth things I'm interested in or curiuos about to learn more. That's why some of the projects will be my idea but some of them can be found online. I recently purchased an online course ([link](https://codewithmosh.com/p/python-projects-for-beginners)) which includes some Python projects, so I will take some projects from there as well. However, before I start working on the really interesting projects for me, I am firstly planning on to do some really easy projects to remind myself Python and to get used to using GitHub. (I might erase those easy projects later) 

📝 In the future (hoping to be near future), I also want to use this GitHub page for a notebook for my Price Analysis studies. I'm also interested in crytocurrincies and crypto trading but I know so little about price analysis. So I'm hoping to learn some more here and publish this process to gain better understanding.
