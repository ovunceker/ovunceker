## Hello everyone 👋

🤔 The main reason why I opened up this GitHub page is to share the projects I'll be working on and to have a place for writing down the things I want to learn. 

👨‍💻 I've recently come across with data science and it instantly grasped my attention as a math person. I already knew some amount of Python and then I took an online course on Machine Learning (using Python), SQL, and Data Science (using R). That's why on most of my projects, I'll be using Python, SQL and R. My main goal for working on these projects is to combine these coding skills with the down to earth things I'm interested in or curiuos about to learn more. That's why some of the projects will be my idea but some of them can be found online.
